Missing an event on this website?

Some events may not be published in a dedicated post. Instead, they are visible in the [calendar](/calendar) and will be annouced in the "Stammtisch" WhatsApp group. You can find this group as part of the Bioinformatics WhatsApp community, which also contains all Bachelor group chats and a Master's group chat.

If you are not yet part of the Bioinformatics WhatsApp community, reach out to a member of the student council or send us an email at [fsbioinf@uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:fsbioinf@uni-frankfurt.de)!
