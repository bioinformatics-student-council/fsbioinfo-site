We are happy to annouce that the university has released the results of the BSc/MSc program evaluation.

By collecting feedback in advance and discussing it with involved professors, as well as the university's SLI department, the student council was able to voice concerns shared by a number of students. We hope that the issues will be addressed in the upcoming reaccreditation of the BSc/MSc programs.

The final report (in German) is available below.
