The Student Council for Bioinformatics warmly welcomes you to Goethe University in Frankfurt!

We are excited to soon welcome you as new bioinformatics students!

This semester, the **orientation event** will take place on **Friday, October 11, 2024**. On this day, we will show you around the Bockenheim and Riedberg campuses, provide general information about your studies, answer all your questions, and give you the opportunity to get to know your fellow students and us, the student council.

Please remember to register here: https://forms.gle/1KB18yfEZ8iP6v8m7

The event starts at **3:00 PM** in **Lecture Hall I** (Lecture Hall Center, corner of Merton-/Gräfstraße) on **Campus Bockenheim**. After a welcome presentation, we’ll continue with a campus rally, where you’ll form groups and visit various stations to explore the campus. Afterwards, we’ll take public transport to Campus Riedberg, where we’ll give you a short tour before ending the day with a relaxed barbecue. After the barbecue, we’ve prepared music and games, giving you the chance to meet other students—including those from higher semesters—in a friendly atmosphere.

From Campus Riedberg, the subway runs towards the city center every 15 minutes until just before 1:00 AM, and then every half hour, so you don’t have to worry about getting home.

Additionally, we strongly recommend taking the **pre-semester course in computer science**, which covers both mathematical and computer science topics and provides an introduction to programming. This makes it an ideal preparation for your first semester. More information and registration can be found here:

The event is organized on a voluntary basis by the student council—so by other students. The consumption of alcohol is explicitly allowed but, of course, completely optional.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at fsbioinf@uni-frankfurt.de.

We’re looking forward to seeing you!
