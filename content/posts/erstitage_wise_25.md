Gude Bioinformatics Freshers!*

The Bioinformatics Student Council warmly welcomes you to Goethe University Frankfurt. We are excited to greet you soon as new bioinformaticians!

This semester, the orientation event will take place over two days:

- **Thursday, October 9, 2025**, starting at 2:00 PM in Lecture Hall III at the Bockenheim Campus, where most computer science lectures are held. After a welcome and an introductory presentation, we‚Äôll continue with a campus rally, where you‚Äôll get to know each other in groups while exploring the campus. Afterwards, we have a small activity prepared for you, and from 6:00 PM onwards we‚Äôll round off the day with an open evening program, most likely at Caf√© Koz.
- **Friday, October 10, 2025**, starting at 4:30 PM at the Riedberg Campus ‚Äî this is where biology lectures, and in the future computer science lectures as well, take place. In Lecture Hall 1 of the Biologicum (Room -1.202), you‚Äôll get the second part of the introductory presentation, introductions of professors, and another rally to explore the Riedberg Campus. From 7:00 PM we‚Äôll meet for a barbecue, and at 8:00 PM the Semester Opening Party will begin, where you can meet fellow students as well as upper-year students in a relaxed atmosphere.

The event is organized on a voluntary basis by the Student Council. Alcohol is allowed but, of course, completely optional.
