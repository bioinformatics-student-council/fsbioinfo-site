This semester, the **master’s** **orientation event** will take place on **Thursday, 17.04.2025 from 3 pm**.

Meeting point is at **3 pm at lecture hall H1 (Arabic, not Roman room no.) in the Hörsaalgebäude (lecture hall building) at Campus Bockenheim,** Gräfstraße 52, 60486 Frankfurt (gray concrete building with Goethe University inscription, directly on Gräfstraße).

A short introductory presentation will be followed by a guided tour of the Bockenheim campus.

We will then travel by public transport to the Riedberg campus, where a short orientation rally will take place. You will need a valid semester ticket (Deutschlandticket) for the trip. You can find information about this on the AStA website (https://asta-frankfurt.de/angebote/kultur-mobilitaet/semesterticket).

Afterwards we will end the day together with other students with a barbecue and beer.

**Please remember to register in advance - you can also indicate your food preferences.**
