![Bioinformatics Student Council](/images/about.jpg)

The Bioinformatics Student Council is a group of volunteer bioinformatics students at Goethe University Frankfurt. Our goal is to make studying better for everyone (see [guiding principles](/principles)).

We help promote the program and the university, and we make it easier for new students to get started in both the bachelor’s and master’s programs. To do this, we organize a welcome day at the beginning of each semester.

We also work on improving study regulations based on what students actually need. This includes being active in university committees to ensure the course structure makes sense, prepares students well for jobs in research or industry, and allows for personal growth. Finally, we help students from other universities transition smoothly and get their previous coursework recognized.

If you have any **questions**, please reach out to our mailing list: [fsbioinf@uni-frankfurt.de](mailto:fsbioinf@uni-frankfurt.de)
